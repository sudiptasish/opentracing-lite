/**
 * Span decorator used in a messaging context to decorate a span.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Decorating a span implies adding additional info about the span. Eventually 
 * they get stored as a tag.
 * 
 * Note that it is not mandatory for all middleware or interceptor to have a span
 * decorator. Whenever someone likes to add extra details before pasing the span over
 * to next component, a decorator can be used. The message context decorator is
 * used whenever a message producer is passing the span to the consumer. It is
 * expected that the producer or any outbound communication interceptor will use
 * this decorator to inject additional information about the span just before
 * sending it to consumer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is no request-response scenario for messaging. Hence it is expected that
 * every interceptor or middleware will receive some context data or header object
 * from the upstream component, from where the required information can be extracted
 * in order to enrich the span.
