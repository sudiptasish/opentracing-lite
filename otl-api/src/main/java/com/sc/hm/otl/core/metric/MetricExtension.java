/**
 * This class hides and serves as a substitute for the underlying metric sub-system

 * 
 * <p>
 * If the underlying metric provider the feature of capturing metrics data of the
 * traceing/span, this class, will delegate all the calls to the underlying system's 
 * metric component.
 * It accomplishes the same with the help of {@link MetricAdapter}. If the
 * associated framework provides an adapter then the same will be loaded by the
 * provider library. If no adapter is found, then the default {@link NoOpMetricAdapter}
 * will be used.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class has method pertaining to various metric source. For example, an event
 * may be originated from a {@link Tracer}, or a {@link Span} or a {@link Scope}.
 * We call them as source. Extension class has APIs to capture all sorts of event
 * emitting from different sources.
