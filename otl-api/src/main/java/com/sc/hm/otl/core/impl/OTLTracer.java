     * This is the method to resume a span.
     * 
     * <p>
     * Resuming a span can happen in case of asynchronous data transfer operation.
     * Let's consider the below flow:
     * 1. Application A is trying to send some event to Application B.
     * 2. The only way to communicate between them is to send persistent message.
     * 3. If Application B is down then the messages will be kept in a queue.
     * 4. Once the Application B comes up, it will start consuming the messages
     *    from the queue.
     * 
     * If Application A is trying to send some contextual info to Application B,
     * it can do so by injecting the appropriate header(s) in the message. Now
     * it may take some time for Application B to consume the message, and till
     * that time, the message would be lying in the queue. If we want to represent
     * the amount of time the message sitting idle in the queue, we need a span for that.
     * 
     * One way to achieve this is that Application A can create a span and inject
     * the context data in the mesaeg header, it has to ensure that the span is
     * never closed. So what is the status of this span then? We can say, that it
     * is now serialized (in dormant state). Remember, that a span can only exist
     * in the memory.
     * 
     * Now once Application B receives the message, it can deserialize the span
     * context and mark it as active (thus resuming the span again). Because this
     * span represents the idle wait time of a message, therefore it must be
     * closed immediately.
     * 
     * <p>For example:
     * <pre><code>
     *   Tracer tracer = ...
     *
     *   SpanContext context = tracer.extract(Format.Builtin.TEXT_MAP_EXTRACT, new XXXAdapter(message));
     *   Span span = tracer.resumeSpan(context)
     *                     .withTag("ABC", "XYZ")
     *                     .start();
     *   
     * </code></pre>
     * 
     * @param context       The span context 
     * @return SpanBuilder
