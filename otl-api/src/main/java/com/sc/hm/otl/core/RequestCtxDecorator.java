/**
 * Span decorator used in a request-response paradigm to decorate a span.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Decorating a span implies adding additional info about the span. Eventually 
 * they get stored as a tag.
 * 
 * Note that it is not mandatory for all middleware or interceptor to have a span
 * decorator. Whenever someone likes to add extra details before pasing the span over
 * to next component, a decorator can be used. The request context decorator is
 * used whenever a component/service is synchronously calling some other service 
 * and expecting a response. It is expected that the calling service will use
 * some interceptor which will use this decorator to inject additional information
 * about the span just before calling the second service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For a typical request-response scenario, it is expected that the caller will
 * pass on a request and a response object to decorate the span. Typically the
 * request object will be used while making the outbound communication, and the
 * response object will be used after receiving a response from the called service.
