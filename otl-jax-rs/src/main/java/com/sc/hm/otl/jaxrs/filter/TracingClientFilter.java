/**
 * Jax-rs Client filters are similar to container request filters.
 * 
 * <p>
 * for any client request invoked from the client API the client request filters
 * {@link ClientRequestFilter} are executed that could manipulate the request. 
 * If not aborted, the outgoing request is then physically sent over to the server
 * side and once a response is received back from the server the client response
 * filters (ClientResponseFilter) are executed that might again manipulate the
 * returned response. Finally the response is passed back to the code that invoked
 * the request. If the request was aborted in any client request filter then the
 * client/server communication is skipped and the aborted response is used in the
 * response filters.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that there is also a concept of Interceptors in jax-rs specification. But
 * they are more connected with the marshalling and unmarshalling of the HTTP message
 * bodies that are contained in the requests and the responses. Note that they are 
 * executed after the filters and only if a message body is present. Hence it is
 * decided to use client filter as they are more suitable for this purpose.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The client request filter will always create a new span to pass the newly
 * created span context (namely the traceId, spanId and the baggage items, if any)
 * to the next service on the chain. The same span would then be closed later by
 * the {@link OTLClientResponseFilter} once it receives the response from the 
 * remote service. User, however, can override the default
 * behavior by specifying the system property <code>-Djax.rs.span</code> 
 * as false. In which case, no new span will be created, but only the contextual
 * data will be passed.
 * 
 * The filter has to be explicitly registered with the {@lick Client} first.
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
     .....
     public Client restClient() {
         Client client = ClientBuilder
             .newBuilder()
             .register(new TracingClientFilter())
             .build();
     }
 
     ....
     ....
 
     public void getName() {
         Client client = restClient();
         client.target("url")
             .request()
             .get(String.class)
     }
 }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can also register the request filter via {@link ClientConfig} as a provider
 * and use it like below:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
     .....
     public Client restClient() {
         ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
         config.register(TracingClientFilter.class);
         return ClientBuilder.newClient(config);
     }
 
     ....
     ....
 
     public void getName() {
         Client client = restClient();
         client.target("url")
             .request()
             .get(String.class)
     }
 }
 * </pre>
