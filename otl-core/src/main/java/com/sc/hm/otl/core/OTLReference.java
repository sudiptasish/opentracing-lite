/**
 * Interface that represents a reference type.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As of now there can be two kind of references:
 *
 * 1. CHILD_OF (default): A Span may be the ChildOf a parent Span. 
 *    In a ChildOf reference, the parent Span depends on the child Span
 *    in some capacity. When a new span is created, the currently
 *    active span would automatically become a parent span and thus
 *    a CHILD_OF relationship is built.
 * 
 * 2. FOLLOWS_FROM: Some parent Spans do not depend in any way on the
 *    result of their child Spans. In these cases, we say merely that
 *    the child Span FollowsFrom the parent Span in a causal sense.
 *    If a Scope exists when the developer creates a new Span then it
 *    will act as its parent, but once the programmer invokes ignoreActiveSpan()
 *    during buildSpan() time, then the new span will be treated as a
 *    FOLLOWS_FROM span.
 * 
 * Once a span has been created, then the reference object will be created to
 * identify the kind fo relationship the newly created span and it's parent might 
 * have. If no active span exist, then the reference will be null.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example 1: Creating CHILD_OF relationship:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     Tracer tracer = ...
 * 
 *     public Client restClient() {
 *         Span span = tracer.buildSpan("...")
 *             .asChildOf(context)
 *             .start();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Because no relationship/reference type is provided, therefore the a CHILD_OF
 * relationship will be established between the parent and the child (newly created)
 * span.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example 1: Creating FOLLOWS_FROM relationship:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     Tracer tracer = ...
 * 
 *     public Client restClient() {
 *         Span span = tracer.buildSpan("...")
 *             .addReference(References.FOLLOWS_FROM, context)
 *             .start();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Here a FOLLOWS_FROM relationship will be established between the parent and
 * the child (newly created) span.
