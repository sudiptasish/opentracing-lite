/**
 * Spring react web client interceptor.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interceptor must be used to intercept client-side HTTP requests. Implementations
 * of this interface can be registered with the {@link WebClient}, so as to 
 * modify the outgoing {@link HttpRequest} in order to inject the tracing headers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As of today, the following headers will be injected:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>X-B3-TraceId</li>
 * <li>X-B3-SpanId</li>
 * <li>X-B3-Sampled</li>
 * <li>X-B3-Baggage-{key}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As of Spring Framework 5, alongside the WebFlux stack, Spring introduced a new
 * HTTP client called WebClient. The WebClient is a modern, alternative HTTP client
 * to {@link RestTemplate}. Not only does it provide a traditional synchronous API,
 * but it also supports an efficient non-blocking and asynchronous approach.
 * 
 * WebClient supports the provision of adding a filter, that can intercept, examine,
 * and modify a client request (or response). Filters are very suitable for adding
 * functionality to every single request since the logic stays in one place. 
 * 
 * Note that, unlike {@link RestClientInterceptor}, it does not have the provision
 * of creating a span. It's only job is to inject the tracing headers into the 
 * outboud client request.
 * 
 * The filter can be added as below:
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 *     WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder()
 *         .filter(new WebClientInterceptor())
 *         .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If a Webclient is initialized just by <code>WebClient webClient = WebClient.create()</code>
 * then it does not give us the provision to add the new interceptor. Therefore
 * replace all such calls with Webclient builder.
 * 
 * You can, however, define the WebClient like below:
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 *     
 *     public WebClient defaultWebClient() {
 *         return WebClient.builder()
 *             .baseUrl(BASE_URL)
 *             ....
 *             ....
 *             ....
 *             .build(); 
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This will trigger the custom bean post processor, which will ensure to inject the
 * the appropriate filter/interceptor into the {@link WebClient}.
